:gear: Mirai Server + Client Varient ‚ùó

Update link change from Naming Desc to Readme.md  

I Recommend using the 'original' source for this as well as just fixing 
and touching up this is most likley the last time this is getting edited Enjoy.

[ 'original' mirai source  for patches / fixes ](https://github.com/jgamblin/Mirai-Source-Code)

This contains code of a mirai botnet varient, both `Server` and `Client`.  I've had this for about two years.

```

 Use it if your curious.
 If you're struggling to compile or run either the Controller or Client, you might need 
 to build and configure this, with the original source or another variant of Mirai to compile together.

 You will need some understanding of C and basic programming knowledge.
 I have not added the full source of this variant as it's similar to the rest that is currently public.
 This is a working source from last time tested.

```
