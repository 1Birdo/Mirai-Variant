:gear: Running the C&C Server ‚ùó

This is just the code for the `Controller` and `Client` from a Mirai variant I've had for about two years.

```

 Use it if you must.
 To build and configure this, you will need the original source or another variant of Mirai.

 If you're struggling to compile or run either the Controller or Client,
 you will need a basic knowledge of C and simple programming skills for it to work properly.
 I have not added the full source of this variant as it's similar to the rest in the world.
