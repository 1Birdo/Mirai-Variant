:gear:  Running the C&C Server  ‚ùó
```

This is just the release of the code for the Controller and Client of a mirai varient 
i had for about two years, Pretty Bad Code.
I have Skidripped it, use if you must i will say to use the actual mirai
source to build this as help if you stuggle compiling / running either the Controller / Client.
You will need a basic knowledge of .C and simple programming skills if you want this to work properly.
I have not add the full source of this varient as it just like the rest, in the WORLD.
